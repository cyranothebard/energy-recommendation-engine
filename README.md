## Project Overview

The Energy Recommendation Engine is a production-quality system that prevents grid blackouts by coordinating energy usage across thousands of commercial buildings. Using distributed computing, deep learning demand forecasting, and portfolio optimization, the system achieves **5.4% grid load reduction** - within industry benchmarks of 2-7% for demand response programs.

**Business Impact**: For metropolitan areas, this represents $2-5M in annual value through prevented blackouts and deferred infrastructure investments.
