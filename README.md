## Project Overview

The Energy Recommendation Engine is a production-quality system that prevents grid blackouts by coordinating energy usage across thousands of commercial buildings. Using distributed computing, deep learning demand forecasting, and portfolio optimization, the system achieves **5.4% grid load reduction** - within industry benchmarks of 2-7% for demand response programs.

**Business Impact**: For metropolitan areas, this represents $2-5M in annual value through prevented blackouts and deferred infrastructure investments.

### Key Features

- **🔮 Predictive Analytics**: LSTM-based 24-hour demand forecasting with weather integration
- **⚡ Grid Coordination**: Portfolio optimization across 13 building types and 15 size categories  
- **📊 Command Dashboard**: Interactive grid operations interface for utility managers
- **🏗️ Production Ready**: Containerized deployment with AWS infrastructure and cost controls
- **📈 Proven Performance**: Validated 5.4% grid reduction with 36.3% realistic compliance rates
